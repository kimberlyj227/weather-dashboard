# Weather Dashboard

### Overview

For this application, the user is able to search for a city and view the current weather conditions and a five day forecast which includes the following data:
    - City name
    - Date
    - Icon representing weather
    - Wind speed (for current data only)
    - Humidity
    - UV index (for current data only)
        - the text changes colors depending on the level of the UV index

The user's search history is saved in local storage so they are able to return to their previous searches, with their most recent search at the top. The user is also able to clear their search history as well.
